# my-first-React-with-TypeScript-and-Spring-with-Java-RESTful-Artificial-Intelligence-project
A friend and I made a little side project

The basics are that a React with TypeScript frontend communicates with the user and a backend Java-based API communicates with an AI (hopefully onboard an actual machine but likely not).

Neither of us are full-stack software engineers, but its better to make mistakes trying than not to, or something.
